 			<h2>About VULTUR</h1>
 			<p>VULTUR is by far the largest project I have worked on, with the largest team I have worked with, consisting of 7 members in total. My role on this project was the lead level and weapon designer. </p>

 					<h2>Lead Level Designer</h1>
 					<p>As the lead level designer I was tasked with guiding the players gameplay experience, structuring the overall narrative the player would undertake throughout the gameplay. The process of creating each level consisted of a plethora of design iterations. Starting with the planning phase, I developed a paper prototype for each level, which was then followed by a grey box version that underwent multiple playtests. Based on the feedback from these sessions I iterated on each level, refining the design to better align with the player experience we aimed to deliver.</p>

 					<h2>Lead Weapon Designer</h1>
 					<p>As the lead weapons designer, my role closely mirrored my responsibilities in level design: designing mechanics to align with the intended player experience and validating those designs through testing.  The process of designing weapons differed from that of levels; rather than using paper prototypes, weapons were developed in order of difficulty and immediately tested with both experienced and novice players. This approach enabled me to design overlapping mechanics while ensuring each weapon was tailored to the player's intended experience, designing for a diverse set of play styles rather than merely implementing standard game mechanics.</p>

 			<p>Developed over 7 days as a part of the Macquarie Re-Entry Game Jam. Terminal Velocity is a fun quick paced interplanetary dodgeball. With an unlimited player limit this game is a blast for any group. This game was awarded "Best Party Game" for the Game Jam.</p>

 					<h2>Lead Creative Design Director</h1>
 					<p>For this project I was the lead creative design director. This role entailed overall game design and management of the team to ensure we all shared the same vision of the project. 

					I also was the lead level designer, this role encouraged rapid playtesting to ensure the level encouraged correct play behaviour.

					This project was done in one week as part of the Macquarie 'Re-entry' Game-Jam. This time pressure made it crucial that our features were simple but still delivered the intended gameplay experience of a shifting power dynamic and tension between players.</p>
